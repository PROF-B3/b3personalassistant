### Chat with Alpha (Chief Assistant)
```
You: Hello Alpha, I'm new here
Alpha: Welcome! I'm Alpha, your chief assistant. I coordinate with other 
      agents to help you with research, knowledge management, and task 
      planning. What would you like to work on today?
```

### Try a Research Task
```
You: Research quantum computing
Alpha: I'll coordinate Beta for research, Gamma for knowledge organization, 
      and Delta for task management. Let's create a comprehensive plan.

Beta: Based on my research, quantum computing uses quantum mechanical 
      phenomena to process information. Key concepts include qubits, 
      superposition, and entanglement...

Gamma: I've created Zettelkasten notes on quantum computing and linked 
       them to your existing knowledge base...

Delta: I've created follow-up tasks for deeper exploration...
```

## ðŸ“š Knowledge Management

### Create Your First Note
```
You: Take notes on machine learning
Gamma: I've created a note on machine learning and linked it to related 
       concepts. I found connections to your existing knowledge about 
       programming and statistics.
```

### Search Your Knowledge
```bash
/search machine learning
/tags ai
/link neural networks
```

### View Connections
```
You: Show me connections to blockchain
Gamma: Blockchain connects to:
       - Cryptography (5 links)
       - Distributed Systems (3 links)
       - Digital Currency (2 links)
