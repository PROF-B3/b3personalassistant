# Via CLI
Gamma: "Create a note about machine learning"
System: Note created: "Machine Learning Fundamentals"
        Linked to: "AI Basics", "Statistics", "Programming"

# Via GUI
Type in center panel: "Take notes on neural networks"
Gamma automatically creates and links notes
```

#### Note Format
```markdown
# Neural Networks Fundamentals

Neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neurons.

## Key Concepts

```

### Searching and Linking

#### Search Commands
```bash
/search neural networks    # Full-text search
/tags machine-learning     # Search by tags
/link neural networks      # Show connections
```

#### Automatic Linking
The system automatically:
- Links related concepts
- Suggests connections
- Creates knowledge graphs
- Identifies patterns

### Example Knowledge Session
```
You: "I'm learning about blockchain technology"
Gamma: "I've created a new note and linked it to your existing 
       knowledge about cryptography and distributed systems. 
       I found 3 related notes in your knowledge base."

You: "Show me connections to blockchain"
Gamma: "Blockchain connects to:
       - Cryptography (5 links)
       - Distributed Systems (3 links)
       - Digital Currency (2 links)

       Would you like me to break this down into subtasks?"

You: "Break it down"
Delta: "Subtasks created:
       1. Research phase (2 hours)
       2. Development (4 hours)
       3. Testing (1 hour)
       4. Documentation (1 hour)"
```
